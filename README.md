Too much boring content in your Facebook/Twitter/Google+ News Feed? Top News Feed helps you find the best posts in the News Feed and Profiles, sorted by likes. No server-side processing involved, no privacy concerns!

Bookmarklet

Note: Does not work in Twitter Search due to a lack of favorite count in posts, but it works in Twitter Profiles.

Due to a CSP bug in Mozilla Firefox, the bookmarklet is being injected through a CSS stylesheet.
